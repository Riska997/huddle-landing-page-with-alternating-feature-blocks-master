## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about CSS Flexbox and Grid for creating responsive layouts. I also refined my skills in using CSS custom properties for maintaining consistent styling throughout the website.


### Continued development

I plan to explore advanced CSS techniques further and deepen my knowledge of JavaScript to incorporate interactive elements into your websites.

### Useful resources
